# Eat_Da_Burger
*A webpage that allows the user to enter in a burger to put on a list then eat it by clicking on it.*

Deployed Page: https://damp-anchorage-39329.herokuapp.com/

The page is deployed via Heroku and all the data is persisted with MySQL.  The use of ORM (Object Relational Mapping) means data is more accessible and easier to provide to the user. ORM allows for quick and easy queries along with the ability to find errors more easily than other methods. ORM also allows the coder to not have to write as much code for every single task the user can do. 

This page is very simple but requires both front end and back end coding.
